The task:
Create an echo server that receives string messages and sends them back in the upper case. Server must support many simultaneous connections.

Here's the guide to run the project:

To run the project, clone the Git repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Alishermale/UpperEcho.git`

Then, navigate to the project directory:

`cd path/to/echo_server`

Finally, start the project by running the following command in the terminal:

`docker-compose up`

This command will build the Docker containers and start the project. You should now be able to access the project at the specified address.
